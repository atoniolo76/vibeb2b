**Highest Engagement:**

*   **\[00:15 - 00:16] - the** - Engagement: 78.5
    *   **Feedback:** This is a very short phrase, but it generated the highest engagement. Consider what preceded this word. Was it a setup for something intriguing? If so, lean into that setup more explicitly in future presentations.

*   **\[00:12 - 00:15] - I'm so confused** - Engagement: 74.6
    *   **Feedback:** This statement of vulnerability interestingly sparked engagement. Consider using this as a way to lead into a problem and then a solution.

*   **\[00:16 - 00:19] - what is happening** - Engagement: 72.5
    *   **Feedback:** Similar to the previous point, expressing confusion seemed to resonate. However, sustained confusion (as seen later) is detrimental. Use this sparingly to draw people in, then quickly transition to clarity.

**Highest Frustration/Confusion:**

*   **\[00:24 - 00:26] - and now I'm neutral again** - Frustration/Confusion: 7.7
    *   **Feedback:** This statement likely confused the audience. Avoid making abrupt shifts in tone or emotion without providing context. If you are going to express a neutral position, make sure to explain why you're taking that position.

*   **\[00:19 - 00:24] - what what is happening I'm so confused I don't even know what's happening anymore bro** - Frustration/Confusion: 4.7
    *   **Feedback:** Extended expressions of confusion are detrimental. While initial vulnerability can engage, sustained confusion will frustrate the audience. If you're genuinely lost, pause, collect your thoughts, and clearly articulate what's confusing you.

*   **\[00:26 - 00:30] - how's it going to beat your ass** - Frustration/Confusion: 4.8
    *   **Feedback:** This is likely inappropriate for a professional setting and contributed to frustration/confusion. Avoid aggressive or confrontational language. Consider the impact your word choice has on your audience.

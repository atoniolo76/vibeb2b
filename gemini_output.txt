**Highest Engagement:**

1.  **[00:15 - 00:16] - the** - Engagement: 78.5
    *   **Feedback:** This single word, "the," garnered the highest engagement. Analyze the context surrounding this moment. What were you about to say? Could you build on this by strategically pausing before key words or phrases to build anticipation?

2.  **[00:12 - 00:15] - I'm so confused** - Engagement: 74.6
    *   **Feedback:** While seemingly negative, expressing confusion briefly piqued audience interest. This suggests vulnerability or unexpected honesty can be engaging. However, be cautious about overusing this. If you're *actually* confused, address it quickly and move towards clarity.

3.  **[00:16 - 00:19] - what is happening** - Engagement: 72.5
    *   **Feedback:** Similar to the previous point, this question grabbed attention. Asking rhetorical questions or posing a mystery can be a good engagement technique. However, ensure you resolve the "what is happening" quickly, or it will lead to frustration.

**Highest Frustration/Confusion:**

1.  **[00:24 - 00:26] - and now I'm neutral again** - Frustration/Confusion: 7.7
    *   **Feedback:** This statement likely confused the audience. Avoid sudden shifts in tone or unexplained statements. If you are changing direction, clearly signal why and how it connects to the overall topic.

2.  **[00:26 - 00:30] - how's it going to beat your ass** - Frustration/Confusion: 4.8
    *   **Feedback:** This statement is inappropriate for a professional meeting and is likely the source of confusion. Remove aggressive or violent language from your presentations.

3.  **[00:19 - 00:24] - what what is happening I'm so confused I don't even know what's happening anymore bro** - Frustration/Confusion: 4.7
    *   **Feedback:** While a brief moment of confusion can be engaging, prolonged expressions of uncertainty are detrimental. If you are lost, acknowledge it concisely, and then state how you plan to regain clarity (e.g., "Let me quickly recap the previous point to ensure we're all on the same page"). Avoid informal language like "bro."
